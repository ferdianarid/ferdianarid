<ContentText>At Bit, we build tools for over 100,000 developers working with components. Our tools help developers build, reuse, and collaborate on independent components to speed up development and improve application quality.</ContentText>
<ContentText>Since day one weve been dogfooding our own tools, while letting components drive our architecture and development process. A great advantage of this is the ability to enjoy the benefits of Micro Front-Ends.</ContentText>
<ContentText>By splitting the front-end monolith into smaller codebases, front-end teams can enjoy similar benefits to those of microservices: maintainable codebases, autonomous teams, independent releases, and incremental upgrades.</ContentText>
