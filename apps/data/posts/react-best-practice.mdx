<ContentText>To be a good programmer especially as a Frontend or React Developer, you must own or implement best practices in the project you are working on, so that you can avoid code concurrency, streamline algorithm and can easily collaborate with other programmers. Best practices among others is..</ContentText>

<TitleText isLight>Naming Conventions</TitleText>
<ContentText>- Your filenames should always have consistent casing and extension. Either use .js or .jsx as explained in code structure for extension. And use PascalCase of camelCase for filenames.</ContentText>

<ContentText>- Not only name filename but also make sure that your variable, function, class, and component name are consistent with case.</ContentText>

<ContentText>- In React, name on your file must be same as React Component. Inside that file without a hyphen in the filename. For Example Form-Authentication rename to FormAuthentication </ContentText>

<ContentText>- When create Function for Reducer Action, write Action Types as eventNames. For Example: ADD_TO_CART, REGISTRATION_PENDING, LOGIN_SUCCESS as this matches with typical Conventions in most programming language for declaring a constants variable</ContentText>

<TitleText isLight>Good Commenting Practices</TitleText>
<ContentText>- Use comment to explain <i>Why you did something like this or how you did it</i> If you find yourself explaining how you did something, then its time to make your code self-explanatory</ContentText>

<ContentText>- Write Legal, Informative and offer clarification</ContentText>

<ContentText>- Not write comment that are obvious and redudant</ContentText>

<TitleText isLight>Using ES6 Features</TitleText>
<ContentText>- Use Destructure, always Destructure your props helps make your code more cleaner and maintainable. It also makes assigning object properties to variable feels like much less or chore.</ContentText>

<ContentText>- Use const instead var or let. const let you check that variable should always stay constant or unique. let indicated that values of the variable can be reassign or can be changed</ContentText>

<ContentText>- Use Arrow Function for Write Function Component in React for more cleaner code. Arrow function allow simplifying your code to a singleline</ContentText>

<TitleText isLight>Use Fragments Instead of Div</TitleText>
<ContentText>React Components need to return code wrapped in a single tag usually div element or React Fragment. Using div increase DOM size especially in huge project because more tags div unused in DOM nodes you have. And the website need more memory to use load element in website. This leads to lower pagespeed and potentially poor user experience.</ContentText>

<TitleText isLight>Avoid using Indexes as Key of Props</TitleText>
<ContentText>React use keys to uniquely identify items in an array. With keys, react can pinpoint which item has been added, changed, or remove from the array</ContentText>

<TitleText isLight>Code Structure</TitleText>
<ContentText>Make sure your import statement are on new line, as this make your import clean and easy to understand for all component, third party libraries and other.</ContentText>

<ContentText>Dont confused with single quote or double quotes, use single quote for javascript code and use double quote for JSX Code or equivalent. This is make you easily to maintain your code in future</ContentText>
